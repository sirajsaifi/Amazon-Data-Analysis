## **Project Overview**

I have worked on analyzing a dataset of over 20,000 sales records from an Amazon-like e-commerce platform. This project involves extensive querying of customer behavior, product performance, and sales trends using PostgreSQL. Through this project, I have tackled various SQL problems, including revenue analysis, customer segmentation, and inventory management.

The project also focuses on data cleaning, handling null values, and solving real-world business problems using structured queries.

An ERD diagram is included to visually represent the database schema and relationships between tables.

## **Task: Data Cleaning**

I cleaned the dataset by:
- **Removing duplicates**: Duplicates in the customer and order tables were identified and removed.
- **Handling missing values**: Null values in critical fields (e.g., customer address, payment status) were either filled with default values or handled using appropriate methods.

## **Handling Null Values**

Null values were handled based on their context:
- **Customer addresses**: Missing addresses were assigned default placeholder values.
- **Payment statuses**: Orders with null payment statuses were categorized as “Pending.”
- **Shipping information**: Null return dates were left as is, as not all shipments are returned.

## **Objective**

The primary objective of this project is to showcase SQL proficiency through complex queries that address real-world e-commerce business challenges. The analysis covers various aspects of e-commerce operations, including:
- Customer behavior
- Sales trends
- Inventory management
- Payment and shipping analysis
- Forecasting and product performance
  

## **Identifying Business Problems**


1. Top Selling Products
Query the top 10 products by total sales value. Challenge: Include product name, total quantity sold, and total sales value.

2. Revenue by Category
Calculate total revenue generated by each product category.
Challenge: Include the percentage contribution of each category to total revenue.

3. Average Order Value (AOV)
Compute the average order value for each customer.
Challenge: Include only customers with more than 5 orders.

4. Monthly Sales Trend
Query monthly total sales over the past year.
Challenge: Display the sales trend, grouping by month, return current_month sale, last month sale!

5. Customers with No Purchases
Find customers who have registered but never placed an order.
Challenge: List customer details and the time since their registration.

6. Least-Selling Categories by State
Identify the least-selling product category for each state.
Challenge: Include the total sales for that category within each state.

7. Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV)
Calculate the total value of orders placed by each customer over their lifetime.
Challenge: Rank customers based on their CLTV.

8. Inventory Stock Alerts
Query products with stock levels below a certain threshold (e.g., less than 10 units).
Challenge: Include last restock date and warehouse information.

9. Shipping Delays
Identify orders where the shipping date is later than 3 days after the order date.
Challenge: Include customer, order details, and delivery provider.

10. Payment Success Rate 
Calculate the percentage of successful payments across all orders.
Challenge: Include breakdowns by payment status (e.g., failed, pending).

11. Top Performing Sellers
Find the top 5 sellers based on total sales value.
Challenge: Include both successful and failed orders, and display their percentage of successful orders.

12. Product Profit Margin
Calculate the profit margin for each product (difference between price and cost of goods sold).
Challenge: Rank products by their profit margin, showing highest to lowest.

13. Most Returned Products
Query the top 10 products by the number of returns.
Challenge: Display the return rate as a percentage of total units sold for each product.

14. Orders Pending Shipment
Find orders that have been paid but are still pending shipment.
Challenge: Include order details, payment date, and customer information.

15. Inactive Sellers
Identify sellers who haven’t made any sales in the last 6 months.
Challenge: Show the last sale date and total sales from those sellers.

16. IDENTITY customers into returning or new
if the customer has done more than 5 return categorize them as returning otherwise new
Challenge: List customers id, name, total orders, total returns

17. Top 5 Customers by Orders in Each State
Identify the top 5 customers with the highest number of orders for each state.
Challenge: Include the number of orders and total sales for each customer.

18. Top 10 product with highest decreasing revenue ratio compare to last year(2022) and current_year(2023)
Challenge: Return product_id, product_name, category_name, 2022 revenue and 2023 revenue decrease ratio at end Round the result
Note: Decrease ratio = cr-ls/ls* 100 (cs = current_year ls=last_year)

## **Learning Outcomes**

This project enabled me to:
- Design and implement a normalized database schema.
- Clean and preprocess real-world datasets for analysis.
- Use advanced SQL techniques, including window functions, subqueries, and joins.
- Conduct in-depth business analysis using SQL.
- Optimize query performance and handle large datasets efficiently.
